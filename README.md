# image processing
Specific solutions for document detection. I will describe the problems of Canny edge detection.

## Images are unique
Every gray image has a unique: 
1. Pixel intensity histogram
2. Foregroud
3. Backgroud
4. Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) which is based on foreground and background selections

## Code implementation
The code will be implemented in Python for ease of visualization. I will use some standard images and convert them into integer based 8bit images.
